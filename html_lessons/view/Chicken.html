        The <b>Chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated red junglefowl species that are originally from
        Southeast Asia.<br>
        They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowls (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
        junglefowl, and green junglefowl).<sup>[1]</sup>
        Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has
        been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen,
        and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming
        both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting,
        which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.

    <p>
        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia,
        Southeast Asia, and East Asia,<sup>[3]</sup> but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and
        Africa
        originated from the Indian subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in<br> ancient Egypt in the
        mid-15th century BC,
        with the "bird that gives birth every day"<br> having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
        according to the<br> annals of Thutmose III.<sup>[4][5][6]</sup>
        They are known in ancient Greece from the 5<sup>th</sup><br> century BC.<sup>[7][8]</sup>
